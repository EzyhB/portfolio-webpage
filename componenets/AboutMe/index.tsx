            Along with being a developer, Im also a content creator, business
            aficionado, an artist &#38; a fitness enthusiast. I have a keen
            interest in computational thinking &#38; I love collaborating with
            other developers to make software that is meaningful and fulfills
            the purpose of our user stories.

            I pride myself in writing code that is clean, easy to maintain &#38;
            im always curious about the different ways in which I can make this
            practice more effective. Although I have a very sharp eye for detail
            and can pick at some of the smallest things, Iâ€™m very goal
            orientated and like to finish what I started on time, finding the
            perfect balance between the key to my accomplishments
